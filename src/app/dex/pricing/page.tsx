              In the previous chapter, we learned that a decentralized exchange
              is a place where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies with no one
              in the middle. But how do they determine how much you can get when
              you buy or sell?They achieve this automatically by looking at some
              values in the exchange. Each decentralized exchange has a
              different system for this, and we will take an example of Uniswap,
              which is the biggest decentralized exchange.
