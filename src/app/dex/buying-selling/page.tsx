              Exchanges are the place where you can buy or sell one currency
              with another currency. Usually, there is a company in the middle
              who facilitates this trade. If you want to buy currency A for
              currency B, you send currency B to the company. The company finds
              the seller for the currency A, and then send the currency A to
              you.

                cryptocurrencies with no one in the middle. If you want to buy
